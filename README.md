# CSS calc() Function Miscalculation with Percentages

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug involving the `calc()` function in CSS when used with percentage values, especially in the context of flexbox or grid layouts.  The `calc()` function may not perform the calculation correctly, resulting in unexpected element dimensions.

The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a possible solution depending on the specific layout requirements. 

**Problem:** Inconsistent or unexpected results when subtracting pixels from a percentage value using `calc()` within flexible layouts.

**Potential Causes:**
* Incorrect initial value used in the calculation. 
* Interactions with flexbox or grid properties.
* Conflicting CSS rules.

**Solutions (See `bugSolution.css`):**
* Using alternative layout techniques to achieve the desired effect. 
* Explicitly setting the initial value for the calculation, if possible.
* Debugging CSS rules for conflicts.
